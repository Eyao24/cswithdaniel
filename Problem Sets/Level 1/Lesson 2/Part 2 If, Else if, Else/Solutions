1. You should think of the code as the same as the following:

if (grade >= 90) {System.out.println("A");}
else
{
  if (grade >= 80) {System.out.println("B");}
  else
  {
    if (grade >= 70) {System.out.println("C");}
    else {System.out.println("F");}
  }
}
  
  a. When grade is 90, grade >= 90 is true. Then the program prints "A".
  The else block (lines 4-12) is skipped since the if block is executed.
  
  b. When grade is 83, grade >= 90 is false. Then the execution goes to the else block (line 4).
  grade >= 80 is true, which means that the program prints "B" (line 6).
  The else block afterward (lines 7-11) is skipped because the if block is executed.
  
  c. When grade is 79, grade >= 90 is false. Then the execution goes to the else block (line 4).
  grade >= 80 is false, which means that the execution goes to the corresponding else block (line 7).
  grade >= 70 is true, which means that the program prints "C" (line 9).
  The else block afterward (line 10) is skipped because the if block is executed.
  
  d. When grade is 57, grade >= 90 is false. Then the execution goes to the else block (line 4).
  grade >= 80 is false, which means that the execution goes to the corresponding else block (line 7).
  grade >= 70 is false, which means that the execution goes to the corresponding else block (line 10).
  Then "F" is printed.
  
  
2.

if (grade >= 90) {System.out.println("A");}
if (grade >= 80) {System.out.println("B");}
if (grade >= 70) {System.out.println("C");}
else {System.out.println("F");}

  a. grade = 90
  grade >= 90 is true. "A" is printed.
  grade >= 80 is true. "B" is printed.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  The else block is skipped since line 37 is executed.
  
  b. grade = 83
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is true. "B" is printed.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  The else block is skipped.
  
  c. grade = 79
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  The else block is skipped.
  
  d. grade = 57
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is false.
  The else block is executed since line 37 is skipped. "F" is printed.
  
  
3. 
  
if (grade >= 90) {System.out.println("A");}
else if (grade >= 80) {System.out.println("B");}
if (grade >= 70) {System.out.println("C");}
else {System.out.println("F");}

  a. grade is 90
  grade >= 90 is true. "A" is printed.
  Line 67 is skipped since line 66 is executed.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  Line 69 is skipped since line 68 is executed.
  
  b. grade is 83
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is true (and line 66 was skipped). "B" is printed.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  Line 69 is skipped since line 68 is executed.
  
  c. grade is 79
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is true. "C" is printed.
  Line 69 is skipped since line 68 is executed.
  
  d. grade is 57
  grade >= 90 is false.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is false.
  Line 69 is executed since line 68 is skipped. "F" is printed.
  
  
4. Remember that without brackets only the first statement is attached to the if or else.
So on line 100, the if is not part of the else. The ; is part of the else.
The ; after the else is a very bad practice.
We can respace the code as follows:

if (grade >= 90) System.out.println("A");
else;
if (grade >= 80) System.out.println("B");
else if (grade >= 70) System.out.println("C");
else;
System.out.println("F");

  a. grade is 90
  grade >= 90 is true. "A" is printed. else; is skipped.
  grade >= 80 is true. "B" is printed.
  Lines 103 and 104 are skipped since line 102 is executed.
  "F" is printed.
  
  b. grade is 83
  grade >= 90 is false. Line 101 is executed, but it does nothing.
  grade >= 80 is true. "B" is printed.
  Lines 103 and 104 are skipped since line 102 is executed.
  "F" is printed.
  
  c. grade is 79
  grade >= 90 is false. Line 101 is executed, but it does nothing.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is true (and line 102 is skipped). "C" is printed.
  Line 104 is skipped since line 103 is executed.
  "F" is printed.
  
  d. grade is 57
  grade >= 90 is false. Line 101 is executed, but it does nothing.
  grade >= 80 is false.
  grade >= 70 is false. Line 104 is executed, but it does nothing.
  "F" is printed.
  
  
5.

int i1 = 7;
if (i1 == 7)
{
    System.out.println(i1++);
}
else if (i1 == 8) {System.out.println(++i1);}
if (i1 == 8) System.out.println(++i1);
else {} if (i1 == 9) {System.out.println(i1++);}
System.out.println(i1);

Output:
7
9
9
10

Explanation:
i1 is 7 on line 136.
i1 == 7 is true, so line 139 is executed.
Remember that i1++ is done after the printing.
So 7 is printed, and i1 becomes 8.
Line 141 is skipped since lines 137 to 140 were executed.
i1 == 8 is true, so System.out.println(++i1); is executed.
Remember that ++i1 is done before the printed.
So i1 becomes 9, and 9 is printed.
Then the else {} is skipped.
i1 == 9 is true. Then 9 is printed, and i1 becomes 10.
Finally, 10 is printed.
  
  
6. Original code:

if (6 > 3) System.out.println(5); System.out.println(9);
else if (5 < 6) System.out.println(7); System.out.println(3);
else System.out.println(3);

Fixed code:

if (6 > 3) {System.out.println(5); System.out.println(9);}
else if (5 < 6) {System.out.println(7); System.out.println(3);}
else System.out.println(3);

Explanation: Originally, if (6 > 3) didn't enclose System.out.println(9);
Then, the else on line 169 had no matching if block.
(Note that there cannot be statements between matching if and else blocks.)
Similarly, the if (5 < 6) originally didn't enclose System.out.println(3);

After adding the brackets, both problems are solved.
