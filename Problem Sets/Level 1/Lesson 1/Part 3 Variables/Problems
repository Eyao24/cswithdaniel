1.
  a. What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?
  b. Can you declare a variable without initializing it?
  c. Can you initialize a variable without declaring it?
  d. Can you print a variable without initializing it?

2.
  a. List all 8 primitive data types.
  b. Identify the primitive data types that store integers only. List them in increasing order of memory size.
  c. Identify the primitive data types that store numbers including non-integers.
     Which one has more precision and takes up more memory space?
  d. What do the remaining primitive data types store?
  
3. Explain everything that is wrong with the following code:
int i;
System.out.println(i);
int i = 5;
j = 7;
System.out.println(k);

4. Use the following variables to print "5false8"
int i = 5;
boolean j = false;
int k = 2;
long l = 6;

5. Determine the output:
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
int k = 3;
System.out.println(i + "abc" + j + k);
System.out.println(i + "abc" + (j + k));

6. Determine the output:
int i = 9;
int j = 2;
i %= j;
System.out.println("" + i + j);

7. Determine the output:
  a. int q = 3;
     System.out.println(q++);
  b. int q = 3;
     System.out.println(++q);

8.
  a. Determine the output:
  double d1 = 5.7;
  double d2 = 9.5;
  d1 = d2;
  d2 = d1;
  System.out.println(d1 + " " + d2);
  
  b. Did the code successfully swap the variables? If not, fix the code to make it swap the variables.
