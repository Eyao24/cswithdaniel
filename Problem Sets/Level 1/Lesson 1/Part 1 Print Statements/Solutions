Original code:
Public class 1Lesson
{
    system.out.print(asdf)
}

Fixed code:
public class Lesson1
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.print("asdf");
    }
}

Errors fixed:
  Public should be lowercase
  Class name cannot start with a number. 1Lesson is not valid.
  A main method is needed.
  The print statement needs a semicolon.
  asdf needs quotes around it.
  system should be System since Java is case sensitive.

  a. System.out.print("text"); will just print "text", while
     System.out.println("text"); will print "text" and a new line afterward.
     Anything printed immediately after a println() statement will be on a new line.

  b. System.out.println("\"");
     In general you need \" for a " to be printed.
     
  c. System.out.println("\\");
     In general you need \\ for a \ to be printed.
     
  d. Printing "\n" prints a new line.
     For example, System.out.println("abc\ndef"); will print abc on one line and def on the next.
     
  e. // comments out everything directly to the right of it.
     Exception: if // is in quotes or a block comment then it isn't a comment.
     For example,
     System.out.println("//");
     prints "//" while
     //System.out.println("//");
     doesn't do anything.

System.out.print("qwerty");
System.out.println("asdf");
System.out.println("zxcv");
System.out.println();
//System.out.println();
System.out.println("//");
//System.out.println("//");

Output:
qwertyasdf
zxcv

//

Notes:
asdf is printed on the same line as qwerty since println prints a new line afterward, not before the text.
//System.out.println();
and
//System.out.println("//");
are comments, while 
System.out.println("//");
prints "//".
