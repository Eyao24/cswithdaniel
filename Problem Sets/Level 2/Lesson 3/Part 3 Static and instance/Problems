2.
  a. Create a BankAccount class with all variables and methods listed in problem 1a.

     For turnLeft and turnRight, you can just print "Turning left" and "Turning right" respectively.
     For accelerate, increase the speed by 1 unless the speed is already maximum.
     For brake, decrease the speed by 1 unless the speed is already 0.
