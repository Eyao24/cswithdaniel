1. Determine the output:
public class Problem1
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        new Something(5, 7);
        new Something(2, 3, "abc");
        new Something(5, 7).display();
        new Something(2, 3, "abc").display();
    }
}
class Something
{
    int a, b;
    String c;
    public Something(int a, int b)
    {
        this.a = a;
        b = this.b;
        c = "" + a + b;
    }
    public Something(int a, int b, String s)
    {
        this(a, b);
        c = s;
    }
    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c);
    }
}


2.
  a. Create a class named BankAccount that contains an instance variable balance.
  b. Create a constructor that takes in an int and properly sets the balance variable.
  c. Create another constructor that has no parameters and sets the balance variable to 0.
  d. Create an instance method deposit that takes in an int and adds that int to the balance if it is positive.
  e. Create an instance method withdraw that takes in an int and subtracts that int from the balance.
     If the parameter is greater than the balance or less than 0 then do nothing.
  f. Create an instance method getBalance that takes no parameters and returns the balance.


3.
  a. Create a class named City that has instance variables name and population (name is a String, population is an int).
  b. Create a constructor that sets the instance variables using parameters.
  c. Create a method named display that displays all the instance variables.
  d. Create 5 instances of City with any name and population (in the main method of your program).
  e. Call the display method for each of the 5 instances of City.
  f. Create an array of Cities (City[]) of length 5. Fill the array of cities with the 5 cities you created.
  g. Create a class named Country that has instance variables name and continent (both of type String).
  h. Create an instance variable in Country named cities of type City[].
  i. Create a constructor in Country that takes two Strings and a City[] and sets the variables using the parameters.
  j. Create a method named totalPopulation that returns the sum of the populations of each city.
  k. Create a method named display that displays the country name, continent, and the information of all the cities.
  l. Create an instance of Country using the array you created in part f. Call the display and totalPopulation methods.
