1. Determine the output of the following:
int[] arr = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
{
    arr[i] = i;
}
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
{
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println(sum);


2. Determine the output of the following:
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("a.txt"));
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
   writer.println(i);
}
writer.close();
Scanner reader = new Scanner(new File("a.txt"));
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
   int j = reader.nextInt();
   if (i % 2 == 0) {System.out.println(j);}
}


3. Determine the output of the following:
int[] arr1 = {3, 5, 7};
int[] arr2 = arr1;
arr2[1] = 4;
System.out.println(arr1[0] + arr1[1] + arr1[2]);


4. Determine the output of the following:
public class MyClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = {3, 7, 5, 6, 1};
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : arr)
        {
            sum += i;
            if (i == 5) {continue;}
            System.out.print(i);
        }
        System.out.println("\n" + sum);
        int[] arr2 = new int[1000];
        for (int i = 0; i * i * i < 100; i++)
        {
            arr2[i * i * i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            if (arr2[i] == 1) {System.out.println(i);}
        }
    }
}


5.
  a. Print the odd integers from 1 to 100 inclusive to a file named odd.txt
  b. Prompt the user for an integer n, then print the integers from 1 to n inclusive to a file named n.txt
  c. Read from odd.txt and print the sum of the numbers in odd.txt to a file named oddsum.txt
  d. Read from n.txt and print the sum of the numbers in n.txt to a file named nsum.txt
  e. Read from odd.txt and n.txt and print the sum of the two numbers in a file named sum.txt


6. Assume that ints.txt has a bunch of integers and nothing else.
It is guaranteed that all computations will not exceed the limits of an int.
  a. Print the maximum number of ints.txt.
  b. Print the minimum number of ints.txt.
  c. Print the sum of the numbers in ints.txt.
  d. Print the number of numbers in ints.txt.
  e. Do tasks a to d again except this time print the result to a file named ints.out.


7.
  a. Create a class named Rectangle that instance variables length and width of type double.
  b. Create a constructor that sets the variables using parameters.
  c. Create an instance method named area that returns the area.
  d. Create a Rectangle with length 7 and width 9 (in the main method) and display its area.
  e. Create a static int variable in Rectangle named numRectanglesCreated that increases by 1 each time a Rectangle is created.
  f. Create an instance method named display that displays the length, width, and area of the Rectangle.
