1.
  a. What does a method have to do for it to be considered recursive?
  b. What is a base case, and why should every recursive method have one?
  c. Can every recursive method be written iteratively (without recursion)?
  d. What are the benefits of writing iterative code compared to recursive code?
  e. What are the benefits of writing recursive code compared to iterative code?
 
2.
  a. Create a recursive method that takes an integer n and returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
  b. Determine the return value when 7 is passed into the method, and show all work (don't just do 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7).
  c. Determine what happens when -1 is passed into the method, and show all work.

3. Determine the output:
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        p3(5);
    }
    public static void p3(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 0) {System.out.println(0);}
        else
        {
            System.out.println(n);
            p3(n - 1);
        }
    }
}

4. Determine why the following code causes an error:
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        p3(5);
    }
    public static void p3(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 0) {System.out.println(0);}
        else
        {
            p3(n - 1);
            System.out.println(n);
            p3(n);
        }
    }
}
