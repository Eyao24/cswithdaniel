1. For each of the following arrays, determine whether sequential search can be performed.
  a. {2, 3, 7, 5, 4, 9}
  b. {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}
  c. {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 11, 12, 14}
  d. {9, 7, 5, 3, 1}
  e. {-1, -2, -4, -5, -3}
  f. {-1, -2, -3, -3, -4, -5}
  
2. For each of the following arrays, determine whether binary search can be performed.
  a. {2, 3, 7, 5, 4, 9}
  b. {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}
  c. {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 11, 12, 14}
  d. {9, 7, 5, 3, 1}
  e. {-1, -2, -4, -5, -3}
  f. {-1, -2, -3, -3, -4, -5}

3. Create a method that uses sequential search to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific value in an ArrayList of String.

4. Create a method that uses iterative binary search to determine whether a specific value is in a sorted double array.

5. Create a method that uses iterative binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific value in a sorted double array.

6. Create a method that uses recursive binary search to determine whether a specific value is in a sorted double array.

7. Create a method that uses recursive binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific value in a sorted double array.

8.
  a. What is the advantage of using binary search?
  b. When should you use sequential search instead of binary search?
